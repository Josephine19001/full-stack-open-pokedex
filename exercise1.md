For a Python application for example, in active development by a team of 6, here is my recommendation for the CI set up:

## Linting

Linting ensures code quality and adherence to style guidelines or rules. Some popular tools that can be use include:

- Flake8: Combines PyFlakes, pycodestyle, and Ned Batchelder's McCabe script to check the quality of Python code.
- Black: A code formatter that ensures consistent style across the codebase.
- Pylint: Offers detailed reports and enforces PEP 8 standards.

## Testing

Testing verifies that code changes do not break existing functionality. Here are some testing frameworks/libraries that can be use:

- Unittest: Pythonâ€™s built-in module for writing and running tests.
- Pytest: A versatile testing framework for writing simple unit tests as well as complex functional tests.
- Coverage.py: Measures code coverage of Python programs, this is often used alongside Pytest.

## Building

Building typically involves creating deployable packages. For Python application, this includes:

- Setuptools: Used for packaging Python projects.
- Wheel: A built-package format for Python, making installation faster.
- Docker: For containerizing the application, ensuring consistency across environments.

#### Beyond Jenkins and GitHub Actions, other CI tools include:

- GitLab CI/CD: Integrated within GitLab for version control.
- CircleCI: Known for its speed and simplicity, it supports various environments and languages.

## Self-Hosted vs. Cloud-Based CI

### Self-Hosted

Pros:

- Full control over the environment and data.
- Customizable hardware and software configurations.
- Potential cost savings if existing infrastructure is used.
  Cons:
- Requires maintenance and updates.
- Higher upfront costs for hardware.
- Responsibility for security and uptime.

### Cloud-Based

Pros:

- No maintenance overhead.
- High availability and reliability.
- Scalable and flexible with pay-as-you-go pricing.
  Cons:
- Less control over the environment.
- Dependence on third-party service availability.
- Possible higher long-term costs.

## Decision Factors

To decide between self-hosted and cloud-based, consider:

- Team expertise and time
- Cost and budget
- Scalability and security requirements.
